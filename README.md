codebits-java-API
=================

Sapo codebits API wrapper in Java. [List of public endpoints available](https://codebits.eu/s/api).

API calls results returned as java.lang.String. You may choose any JSON/XML parser to obtain a JSON/XML object.

> **Note:** Currently not supporting format choosing since the API contains issues when using such option, in addition to the fact that not all calls support both formats.
